Numerical methods to solve ordinary differential equations (ODEs) in Rust.



## Installation

To start using the crate in a project, the following dependency must be added in the project's Cargo.toml file:

```rust
[dependencies]
ode_solvers = "0.6.0"
```

Then, in the main file, add

```rust
use ode_solvers::*;
```



## Type alias definition

The numerical integration methods implemented in the crate support multi-dimensional systems. In order to define the dimension of the system, declare a type alias for the state vector. For instance

```rust
type State = Vector3<f64>;
```

The state representation of the system is based on the SVector&lt;T,D&gt; structure defined in the [nalgebra](https://nalgebra.org/) crate. For convenience, ode-solvers re-exports six types to work with systems of dimension 1 to 6: Vector1&lt;T&gt;,..., Vector6&lt;T&gt;. For higher dimensions, the user should import the nalgebra crate and define a SVector&lt;T,D&gt;  where the second type parameter of SVector is a dimension. For instance, for a 9-dimensional system, one would have:

```rust
type State = SVector<f64, 9>;
```

Alternativly, one can also use the DVector&lt;T&gt; structure from the [nalgebra](https://nalgebra.org/) crate as the state representation. When using a DVector&lt;T&gt;, the number of rows in the DVector&lt;T&gt; defines the dimension of the system.

```rust
type State = DVector<f64>;
```


## System definition

The system of first order ODEs must be defined in the `system` method of the `System<T, V>` trait. Typically, this trait is defined for a structure containing some parameters of the model. The signature of the `System<T, V>` trait is:

```rust
pub trait System<T, V> {
    fn system(&self, x: T, y: &V, dy: &mut V);
    fn solout(&self, _x: T, _y: &V, _dy: &V) -> bool {
        false
    }
}
```

where `system` must contain the ODEs: the second argument is the independent variable (usually time), the third one is a vector containing the dependent variable(s), and the fourth one contains the derivative(s) of y with respect to x. The method `solout` is called after each successful integration step and stops the integration whenever it is evaluated as true. The implementation of that method is optional. See the examples for implementation details.



## Method selection

The following explicit Runge-Kutta methods are implemented in the current version of the crate:

| Method         | Name   | Order | Error estimate order | Dense output order |
| -------------- | ------ | ----- | -------------------- | ------------------ |
| Runge-Kutta 4  | Rk4    | 4     | N/A                  | N/A                |
| Dormand-Prince | Dopri5 | 5     | 4                    | 4                  |
| Dormand-Prince | Dop853 | 8     | (5, 3)               | 7                  |

These methods are defined in the modules rk4, dopri5, and dop853. The first step is to bring the desired module into scope:

```rust
use ode_solvers::dopri5::*;
```

Then, a structure is created using the `new` or the `from_param` method of the corresponding struct. Refer to the [API documentation](https://docs.rs/ode_solvers) for a description of the input arguments.

```rust
let mut stepper = Dopri5::new(system, x0, x_end, dx, y0, rtol, atol);
```

The system is integrated using

```rust
let res = stepper.integrate();
```

and the results are retrieved with

```rust
let x_out = stepper.x_out();
let y_out = stepper.y_out();
```

## Continuous Output Model
A continuous output model can be built when solving a system with Dopri5
```rust
let mut stepper = Dopri5::new(system, x0, x_end, dx, y0, rtol, atol);
let mut continuous_output_model = ContinuousOutputModel::default();
let res = stepper.integrate_with_continuous_output_model(&mut continuous_output_model);
```
The continuous output model can then be used to evaluate the solution at any point in the integration interval by calling the `evaluate(x: T)` method
```rust
let value = continuous_output_model.evaluate(1.2);
```
This method returns an `Option<State>` which is `None` if the interrogation point is outside the integration interval. The continuous output model is serializable which allows it to be saved and loaded independently of the system definition and integration process.
