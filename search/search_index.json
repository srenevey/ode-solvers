The following instructions should get you up and running in no time. See the examples and the API documentation for more details. Installation To start using the crate in your project, add the following dependency in your project's Cargo.toml file: [dependencies] ode_solvers = \"0.3.1\" Then, in your main file, add use ode_solvers::*; Type alias definition The numerical integration methods implemented in the crate support multi-dimensional systems. In order to define the dimension of the system, declare a type alias for the state vector. For instance type State = Vector3<f64>; The state representation of the system is based on the SVector<T,D> structure defined in the nalgebra crate. For convenience, ode-solvers re-exports six types to work with systems of dimension 1 to 6: Vector1<T>,..., Vector6<T>. For higher dimensions, the user should import the nalgebra crate and define a SVector<T,D> where the second type parameter of SVector is a dimension. Note that the type T must be f64. For instance, for a 9-dimensional system, one would have: type State = SVector<f64, 9>; System definition The system of first order ODEs must be defined in the system method of the System<V> trait. Typically, this trait is defined for a structure containing some parameters of the model. The signature of the System<V> trait is: pub trait System<V> { fn system(&self, x: f64, y: &V, dy: &mut V); fn solout(&self, _x: f64, _y: &V, _dy: &V) -> bool { false } } where system must contain the ODEs: the second argument is the independent variable (usually time), the third one is a vector containing the dependent variable(s), and the fourth one contains the derivative(s) of y with respect to x. The method solout is called after each successful integration step and stops the integration whenever it is evaluated as true. The implementation of that method is optional. See the examples for implementation details. Method selection The following explicit Runge-Kutta methods are implemented in the current version of the crate: Method Name Order Error estimate order Dense output order Runge-Kutta 4 Rk4 4 N/A N/A Dormand-Prince Dopri5 5 4 4 Dormand-Prince Dop853 8 (5, 3) 7 These methods are defined in the modules rk4, dopri5, and dop853. The Dormand-Prince methods feature: Adaptive step size control Automatic initial step size selection Automatic stiffness detection Sparse or dense output The first step is to bring the desired module into scope: use ode_solvers::dopri5::*; Then, a structure is created using the new or the from_param method of the corresponding struct. Refer to the API documentation for a description of the input arguments. let mut stepper = Dopri5::new(system, x0, x_end, dx, y0, rtol, atol); The system is integrated using let res = stepper.integrate(); which returns Result<Stats, IntegrationError>. Upon successful completion, res = Ok(Stats) where Stats is a structure containing some information on the integration process (such as number of function evaluations). If an error occurs, res = Err(IntegrationError). Finally, the results can be retrieved with let x_out = stepper.x_out(); let y_out = stepper.y_out(); Adaptive Step Size The adaptive step size used in Dopri5 and Dop853 is computed using a PI controller h_{n+1} = h_ns|err_n|^{-\\alpha}|err_{n-1}|^\\beta where s\u200b is a safety factor, |err_n| is the current error , and |err_{n-1}| is the previous error. The coefficients \\alpha and \\beta determine the behavior of the controller. In order to make sure that h doesn't change too abruptly, bounds on the factor of h_n are enforced: f_{min} \\leq s|err_n|^{-\\alpha}|err_{n-1}|^\\beta \\leq f_{max} If s|err_n|^{-\\alpha}|err_{n-1}|^\\beta \\leq f_{min}\u200b , then \u200b h_{n+1} = h_nf_{min} and if s|err_n|^{-\\alpha}|err_{n-1}|^\\beta \\geq f_{max} , h_{n+1} = h_nf_{max} . The default values of these parameters are listed in the table below.

For Dopri5, a 5th order approximation y_1 \u200band a 4th order approximation \\hat{y}_1 are constructed using the coefficients of the method. The error estimator is then err=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{y_{1i}-\\hat{y}_{1i}}{sc_i}} where n\u200b is the dimension of the system and sc_i is a scale factor given by sc_i=a_{tol}+r_{tol}\\max{(|y_{0i}|,|y_{1i}|)} For Dop853, an 8th order approximation y_1\u200b , a 5th order approximation \\hat{y}_1 , and a 3rd order approximation \\tilde{y}_1\u200b are constructed using the coefficients of the method. Two error estimators are computed: err_{5}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{y_{1i}-\\hat{y}_{1i}}{sc_i}} and err_{3}=\\sqrt{\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n\\frac{y_{1i}-\\tilde{y}_{1i}}{sc_i}} which are combined into a single error estimator err=err_5\\frac{err_5}{\\sqrt{err_5^2+0.01err_3^2}} For a thorough discussion, see Hairer et al.

We assume that the elliptical orbit is described by the following classical orbital elements: Semi-major axis: a = 20,000 km Eccentricity: e = 0.7 Inclination: i = 35\u00b0 Right ascension of the ascending node: \u03a9 = 100\u00b0 Argument of perigee: \u03c9 = 65\u00b0 True anomaly: \u03bd = 30\u00b0 The period of an orbit is given by P = 2\\pi\\sqrt{\\frac{a^3}{\\mu}} where \\mu is the standard gravitational parameter. For the Earth, \u03bc = 398600.4354 km 3 /s 2 and thus P = 2.8149 \\cdot 10 4 s = 7.82 hours. The initial position of the spacecraft expressed in Cartesian coordinates is \\mathbf{r} = \\begin{bmatrix} -5007.2484 & -1444.9181 & 3628.5346 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad km and velocity \\mathbf{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} 0.7177 & -10.2241 & 0.7482 \\end{bmatrix} \\quad km/s such that the initial state vector is \\mathbf{s} = [\\mathbf{r}, \\mathbf{v}]^{T} . The equations of motion describing the evolution of the system are \\ddot{\\mathbf{r}} = -\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}\\mathbf{r} where r is the magnitude of \\mathbf{r} . Since the crate handles first order ODEs, this system must be transformed into a state space form representation. An appropriate change of variables y_1 = r_1 , y_2 = r_2 , y_3 = r_3 , y_4 = \\dot{r}_1 = v_1 , y_5 = \\dot{r}_2 = v_2 , y_6 = \\dot{r}_3 = v_3 yields \\dot{y}_1 = y_4 \\dot{y}_2 = y_5 \\dot{y}_3 = y_6 \\dot{y}_4 = -\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}y_1 \\dot{y}_5 = -\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}y_2 \\dot{y}_6 = -\\frac{\\mu}{r^3}y_3 which can be numerically integrated. Implementation The problem is solved using the Dopri5 method. We first import the crate and bring the required modules into scope: use ode_solvers::dopri5::*; use ode_solvers::*; Next, two type aliases are defined: type State = Vector6<f64>; type Time = f64; and a structure containing the parameters of the model is created: struct KeplerOrbit { mu: f64, } The System<V> trait is then implemented for KeplerOrbit : impl ode_solvers::System<State> for KeplerOrbit { // Equations of motion of the system fn system(&self, _t: Time, y: &State, dy: &mut State) { let r = (y[0] * y[0] + y[1] * y[1] + y[2] * y[2]).sqrt(); dy[0] = y[3]; dy[1] = y[4]; dy[2] = y[5]; dy[3] = - self.mu * y[0] / r.powi(3); dy[4] = - self.mu * y[1] / r.powi(3); dy[5] = - self.mu * y[2] / r.powi(3); } } We now implement the main function. The system of ODEs is first created with the corresponding \\mu parameter. The orbital period is then computed and the initial state is initialized. The integration will be carried out using the 5th order Dormand-Prince method. Hence, a Dopri5 structure is created with the system structure, the initial time, the final time, the time increment between two outputs, the initial state vector, the relative tolerance, and the absolute tolerance as arguments. The integration is launched by calling the method integrate() and the result is stored in res . Finally, a check on the outcome of the integration is performed and the outputs can be extracted. fn main() { let system = KeplerOrbit {mu: 398600.435436} let a: f64 = 20000.0; let period = 2.0 * PI * (a.powi(3) / system.mu).sqrt(); let y0 = State::new(-5007.248417988539, -1444.918140151374, 3628.534606178356, 0.717716656891, -10.224093784269, 0.748229399696); let mut stepper = Dopri5::new(system, 0.0, 5.0 * period, 60.0, y0, 1.0e-10, 1.0e-10); let res = stepper.integrate(); // Handle result match res { Ok(stats) => { stats.print(); // Do something with the output... // let path = Path::new(\"./outputs/kepler_orbit_dopri5.dat\"); // save(stepper.x_out(), stepper.y_out(), path); // println!(\"Results saved in: {:?}\", path); }, Err(_) => println!(\"An error occured.\"), } } Results The following figure shows the trajectory resulting from the integration. As expected, the orbit is closed. Some information on the integration process is provided in the stats variable: Number of function evaluations: 62835 Number of accepted steps: 10467 Number of rejected steps: 5 In order to assess the accuracy of the integration, we look at the specific orbital energy which is a constant of the motion. This specific energy is given by \\varepsilon = \\frac{v^2}{2} - \\frac{\\mu}{r} where v is the amplitude of the velocity and r is the distance from the Earth's center to the spacecraft. In theory, this value is constant as long as no external force acts on the system (which is the case here). From the intial conditions, the specific energy of this orbit is \\varepsilon_0 = -9.9650 \\; km^2/s^2 By computing \\varepsilon for each time step and plotting the difference \\varepsilon_i - \\varepsilon_0 , we obtain the following time evolution of the error: As can be seen on this figure, the specific energy is constant up to the 9th digit after the decimal point which shows that the accuracy of the integration is quite good. A higher accuracy can be achieved by selecting smaller values for rtol and atol .","title":"Kepler Orbit"},{"location":"examples/kepler_orbit.html#kepler-orbit","text":"","title":"Kepler Orbit"},{"location":"examples/kepler_orbit.html#problem-definition","text":"For this example, we consider a spacecraft on a Kepler orbit about the Earth and we want to predict its future trajectory.

The crate is first imported and the modules are brought into scope: use ode_solvers::dop853::*; use ode_solvers::*; Type aliases are then defined for the state vector and the time: type State = Vector6<f64>; type Time = f64; Next, we define the problem specific structure which will contain a single parameter: struct ThreeBodyProblem { mu: f64, } for which we implement the System<V> trait: impl ode_solvers::System<State> for ThreeBodyProblem { fn system(&self, _t: Time, y: &State, dy: &mut State) { let d = ((y[0] + self.mu).powi(2) + y[1].powi(2) + y[2].powi(2)).sqrt(); let r = ((y[0] - 1.0 + self.mu).powi(2) + y[1].powi(2) + y[2].powi(2)).sqrt(); dy[0] = y[3]; dy[1] = y[4]; dy[2] = y[5]; dy[3] = y[0] + 2.0 * y[4] - (1.0 - self.mu) * (y[0] + self.mu) / d.powi(3) - self.mu * (y[0] - 1.0 + self.mu) / r.powi(3); dy[4] = -2.0 * y[3] + y[1] - (1.0 - self.mu) * y[1] / d.powi(3) - self.mu * y[1] / r.powi(3); dy[5] = -(1.0 - self.mu) * y[2] / d.powi(3) - self.mu * y[2] / r.powi(3); } } The system is created together with the intial state vector of the spacecraft in the main function. A Dop853 structure is created and the integrate() function is called. The result is handled with a match statement. fn main() { let system = ThreeBodyProblem {mu: 0.012300118882173}; let y0 = State::new(-0.271, -0.42, 0.0, 0.3, -1.0, 0.0); let mut stepper = Dop853::new(system, 0.0, 150.0, 0.001, y0, 1.0e-14, 1.0e-14); let res = stepper.integrate(); // Handle result match res { Ok(stats) => { stats.print(); // Do something with the results... // let path = Path::new(\"./outputs/three_body_dop853.dat\"); // save(stepper.x_out(), stepper.y_out(), path); // println!(\"Results saved in: {:?}\", path); }, Err(_) => println!(\"An error occured.\"), } } Results The trajectory of the spacecraft for a duration of 150 (dimensionless time) is shown on the following figure: On that figure, the Earth is located at (0, 0) and the Moon is at (0.9877, 0). We see that the spacecraft is first on an orbit about the Earth before moving to the vicinity of the Moon. The accuracy of the integration can be assessed by looking at the Jacobi constant. The Jacobi constant is given by C=\\frac{2(1-\\mu)}{d} + \\frac{2\\mu}{r} + x^2 +y^2 - v^2 and is an integral of the motion (i.e. is constant as long as no external force is applied). Based on the initial conditions, the Jacobi constant yields C_0=3.1830 By computing the Jacobi constant at each time step and plotting the difference C-C_0 , we get the figure below: As can be seen on that figure, the Jacobi constant is constant up to the 11th digit after the decimal point. This accuracy is quite reasonable for that kind of problem but if a higher accuracy is required, the relative tolerance and/or the absolute tolerance could be reduced.","title":"Three-body Problem"},{"location":"examples/three_body_problem.html#three-body-problem","text":"","title":"Three-Body Problem"},{"location":"examples/three_body_problem.html#problem-definition","text":"In this problem, we consider the circular restricted three body problem in which a spacecraft evolves under the influence of the Earth and the Moon.
